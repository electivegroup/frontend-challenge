# frontend-challenge

## Introduction

The purpose of this test is to ensure you have a knowledge of design patterns, usability and styling of the modern web applications. Please do not fork the repository and do not push your solution back to github. Please compress your complete git solution and send it to us as zip package. PLease ensure you include .git in your folder so that view your commits. Assumptions: There is no need to implement any backed dependencies (databases, storage, etc). Feel free to use existing libraries when possible Include any instructions (if required) in the INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Deliverable

* Commit your solution
* zip the folder
* Send it back to Elective
